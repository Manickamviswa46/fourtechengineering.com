# Copilot Instructions for fourtechengineering.com

## Project Overview

This is a Node.js project for the Four Tech Engineering website (fourtechengineering.com).

The codebase is currently minimal, consisting only of a `package-lock.json` file, indicating a Node.js setup with npm for package management.

## Architecture

- **Technology Stack**: Node.js with npm
- **Current State**: Empty project with locked dependencies (none installed)
- No major components, services, or data flows defined yet

## Developer Workflows

- **Dependency Installation**: Use `npm install` to install packages listed in `package.json` (when created)
- **Build/Run Commands**: Not defined yet; will be added in `package.json` scripts
- **Testing**: No testing framework configured
- **Deployment**: The `FourTechEngineering_FullDeployment.zip` appears to be the deployment artifact

## Conventions and Patterns

- Package versions are locked via `package-lock.json`
- Follow standard Node.js project structure (e.g., `src/`, `public/`, etc. when added)

## Key Files

- `package-lock.json`: Dependency lock file (currently empty packages object)</content>
